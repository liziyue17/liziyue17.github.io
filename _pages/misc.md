Travel
======

I have a deep passion for traveling, especially hiking and exploring nature. I find great joy in experiencing diverse landscapes, and immersing myself in the beauty of the outdoors. My dream is to find a like-minded companion with whom I can share both professional aspirations and adventures. I believe that working together, supporting each otherâ€™s goals, and embarking on unforgettable journeys would make life even more fulfilling.

Experience
======

I spent half a year at [UC Berkeley P&T](https://pt.berkeley.edu/home), and it was truly one of the happiest times of my life. The experience was both inspiring and unforgettable, filled with new friendships and exciting challenges. Are you P&T approved?
